The H2O Protocol
================

Version 1.0.3 (2018-07-09)

General Information:
* All multibyte fields use network byte order (big endian).
* The protocol is designed to use UDP on 6LoWPAN on IEEE 802.15.4
* The standard port we use is 44555.

Header format
-------------

/---------- Offset (hex, in bytes)
|   /------ Length in bytes
|   |   /-- Field

00  1   Magic Number (0xAC)
        on mismatch, the packet MUST be discarded

01  1   Version (currently 0x01)
        on mismatch, the packet MUST be discarded

02  1   Length (including both header and data)
        if this is longer than the udp payload, the packet MUST be discarded

03  1   Message Type
        most significant four bits: supertype
        least significant vier bits: subtype
            0x1? DATA MESSAGE
                0x11 temperature
                0x12 humidity
                0x19 water level in pump bucket
            0x2? reserved for DATA REQUEST (not yet specified)
                (same subtypes as in 0x1?)
            0x3? CONFIGURATION
                0x31 set measurement interval
            0x9? WARN
                0x99 pump bucket empty
                0x9a contradictory humidity values encountered
                0x9b sensor doesn't send data
            0xA? INFO
                0xa9 pump bucket nearly empty
        all other values:
            reserved for later use. packet MUST be discarded.

04  2   Node ID (6LoWPAN Adress, 16 bits)
        signification depends on the `message type` field:
            0x1?: data source
            0x9b: sensor that doesn't send data

06  2   Checksum
        CRC16-CCITT, calculated over the complete packet (this field set to 0)
        on mismatch, the packet must be discarded

08  *   Data (* length = remainder of packet; that is, value of the length field minus the header length)


Data Format
-----------

/---------- Message Type
|   /------ Offset within data
|   |   /-- Value
11  0   Temperature (signed 16bit integer)
12  0   Humidity (signed 16bit integer)
31  0   interval in seconds (unsigned 32 bit integer)
